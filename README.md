## RL Based Feature Selection


### 1. Basic Code
- install requirements.txt (code implemented on python 3.10.11)

- Original TD based algorithm is implemented in model/rl.py

- Backward TD based Algorithm is implemented in model.new_try.py

### 2. Running

If you want to test  on correlation loss setting, 
run test.py(for orignal TD) and chang args.predefined_reward=True with changing correlation_coefficient based on your preference. 
as I didnt upload arcene or spambase data set, you might need to download those to check their efficiency. (Two moon is avaialable)


### 3. example
 in .ipynb files , you can see the result plottings for various datasets.
